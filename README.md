## cpnt262-a2, Vue/Nuxt Landing Page


### Troubleshooting
- Image sizing
    - My cards are all different sizes and shapes
        - Had to create a div and then assign heights instead of assigning the size to the image
- Cards not lining up next to each other
    - Watched a video, still not working (but I did get some cool tips on how to make my cards look cooler)
        - [GTCoding "How to Design a Responsive Card Using Tailwind Css](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bicdLKn53J0)
        - Finally figured it out after playing with it for two hours, have to write the tailwind on App.vue, not in the component itself
- Prop is loading two images instead of one
    - Never mind I'm just dumb and for some reason was trying to load the image twice on two different components, fixed successfully



### Personal Reflection
- I am honestly really happy with how it turned out
    - With a bit more time and more experience with Vue, this would look a ton better
- In the future I would maybe add a computed property for how many views a post gets
